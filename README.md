# Unsupervised Learning Project with Wine Dataset

This repository contains code for an unsupervised learning project using the Wine dataset. The project focuses on clustering analysis, utilizing techniques such as the elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters, hierarchical clustering with dendrograms, and evaluating cluster quality using silhouette scores.

## Dataset Description

The Wine dataset contains attributes of wines grown in a specific region of Italy. It includes 13 attributes (features) related to chemical analysis of wines. The dataset has three classes, but in this project, we'll be exploring unsupervised learning, which means we won't use class labels for clustering.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- scipy



## **Clustering Techniques Explored**

In this project, we explore the following clustering techniques:


K-means Clustering: Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Hierarchical Clustering: Using dendrograms to visualize the clustering hierarchy.

Evaluation Metrics: Utilizing silhouette scores to assess the quality of clusters.

## Results
After performing clustering analysis, we visualize the clusters and assess their quality using relevant evaluation metrics.
